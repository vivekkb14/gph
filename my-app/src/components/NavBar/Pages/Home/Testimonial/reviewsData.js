Other doctors refused to go for the surgery, dr. ranjith gave a proper medication to reduce the size of the tumor and then operated. I would recommend pet parents to visit Global pet hospital, very genuine service. Tqs a lot',

        text: 'I\'d wholeheartedly suggest this vet to everyone who stays in that area. He really knew what he was doing when my dog had a fall and broke her nails. The vet was calm and extremely careful during the treatment which even my dog loved, and honestly, compared to other vets I\'ve been to before, this one is by far the best. They handled my shih tzu very well, she didn‚Äôt feel any pain when they were treating her which is a priority for any pet parent. Thanks to the Vet and the clinic for taking good care of my dog. I will definitely recommend this clinic to anyone and everyone with a pet. üêæüê∂üòá ',

Did a routine blood check up and got the results within 15 mins as they have in house lab facility as well. Overall experience was really good. Thank you doctor. Will surely recommend everyone to take your pets there.!',
